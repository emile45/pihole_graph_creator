# pihole_graph_creator
Get the domain queries from pihole's internal database and create a pie chart using google's API.

Please take note that the script to make the graphs "script2.bash", in some cases, does not work on Raspbian Lite.
**You could always import the .csv outfile of "pih_db_Extractor.bash" to another bash capable device and run "script2.bash" from there.

A graphic like below should be outputed. I have also added the html file to the repo.
